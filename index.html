        The mission of the <b>BraiNAVLab</b> is investigating and modeling the <b>brain structure and function</b>, as well as their associations with the underlying genetic determinants relying on statistical/machine and deep learning methods.
        The main current research activities focus on modeling <b>structural / functional / effective connectivity, brain microstructure, imaging genetics and brain computer interfaces (BCI)</b>.<br>
        Regarding ML/DL, the focus is on <b>explainable</b> methods allowing to open the box and decrypt the outcomes of the algorithms. The lab activities cover a wide spectrum of applications 
        ranging from neurosciences to translational, with particular emphasis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosys and stroke. The lab is also actively participating to the activities 
        of international standardization initiatives that is ISO/IEC JTC1 within the JPEG DNA IG and DICOM WG32.

    The mission of <b>BraiNavLab</b> is to <b>explore, model, and understand</b> the intricate 
    <b>structure and function of the human brain</b>, uncovering how these are shaped by their 
    <b>underlying genetic determinants</b>. To achieve this, the lab leverages cutting-edge 
    <b>statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Our current research is centered on advancing models of 
    <b>structural, functional, and effective connectivity</b>, as well as 
    <b>brain microstructure, imaging genetics, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI)</b>. 
    In the field of <b>ML/DL</b>, we place a strong emphasis on developing 
    <b>explainable AI techniques</b>â€”designed not only to deliver accurate results but also 
    to <b>open the black box</b> and make algorithmic insights <b>transparent and interpretable</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>BraiNavLab's activities</b> span a wide range of applications, bridging 
    <b>fundamental neuroscience</b> and <b>translational research</b>, with a particular focus on 
    <b>neurodegenerative diseases</b> such as <b>Alzheimer's disease</b>, 
    <b>multiple sclerosis</b>, and <b>stroke</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Beyond research, the lab is actively involved in 
    <b>international standardization efforts</b>, contributing to initiatives such as 
    <b>ISO/IEC JTC1</b>, the <b>JPEG DNA Interest Group</b>, and <b>DICOM WG32</b>, 
    helping shape the future of <b>biomedical data representation and interoperability</b>.
