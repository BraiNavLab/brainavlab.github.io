  description: "The project presented by the RIR Tech4Life aims, through the integration of advanced intelligent technologies, to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the healthcare sector while ensuring personalized and secure solutions to enhance both the patient experience and the efficiency of healthcare facilities. Thanks to close collaboration among nine companies from the Veneto region and the Universities of Padua, Verona, and Ca’ Foscari of Venice, intelligent systems will be developed at various scales of intervention — covering the entire spectrum from the micro level (omics, molecular biology) to the macro level (information systems, robotics) — without neglecting regulatory aspects and compliance with current standards."

  description: "A multiscale integrated approach to the study of the nervous system in health and disease (MNESYS) (DN. 1553 11.10.2022) supported by #NEXTGENERATIONEU (NGEU). Participation to Spoke 2, Silvia F. Storti task leader for UniVR in Work Package 4 - T4.5. Neural dynamics and plasticity. Addressing neuronal dynamics and neuronal plasticity with neurostimulation and fast imaging technologies. Objectives: integrate multi-modal imaging technologies for brain connectomics into medically interpretable AI models and develop connectivity-based machine learning algorithms to address neuronal plasticity in health and disease for the design of personalized treatments. The WP foresees an advance from TRL1 (begin) to TRL3 (end)."
