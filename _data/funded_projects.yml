  description: "The project presented by the RIR Tech4Life aims, through the integration of advanced intelligent technologies, to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the healthcare sector while ensuring personalized and secure solutions to enhance both the patient experience and the efficiency of healthcare facilities. Thanks to close collaboration among nine companies from the Veneto region and the Universities of Padua, Verona, and Ca’ Foscari of Venice, intelligent systems will be developed at various scales of intervention — covering the entire spectrum from the micro level (omics, molecular biology) to the macro level (information systems, robotics) — without neglecting regulatory aspects and compliance with current standards."
