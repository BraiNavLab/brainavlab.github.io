  description: "The project presented by the RIR Tech4Life aims, through the integration of advanced intelligent technologies, to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the healthcare sector while ensuring personalized and secure solutions to enhance both the patient experience and the efficiency of healthcare facilities. Thanks to close collaboration among nine companies from the Veneto region and the Universities of Padua, Verona, and Ca’ Foscari of Venice, intelligent systems will be developed at various scales of intervention — covering the entire spectrum from the micro level (omics, molecular biology) to the macro level (information systems, robotics) — without neglecting regulatory aspects and compliance with current standards."

  description: "Part of AI4BRAVE: AI for modeling of the Brain-Heart Axis in aging. The aim of this project is to contribute to the decryption and modeling of the aging process by focusing on a specific aspect, the brain-heart axis, and relying on XAI as the enabling technology. This is a hot topic that has only recently started to be investigated, mainly in vascular disorders. The availability of large amount of multi-modal data (novel magnetic resonance imaging sequences, clinical, behavioral and genetic data) on the same cohorts and the substantially increased computational power open new perspectives by enabling large scale studies as well as the possibility to mine hidden factors that only advanced AI methods might reveal.

  description: "Aging and artificial intelligence (AI) are key concepts in today’s socio-economic context. Aging is accompanied by structural and functional degeneration that affects quality of life. The goal of AntIAGING is to contribute to the understanding and modeling of this process, focusing on the heart–brain axis. Cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases are among the leading causes of death in aging populations and have the greatest socio-economic impact. It is now evident that these conditions are closely connected, making the study of their interactions one of the central topics in biomedical research. To identify characteristic patterns of the aging process, factors derived from brain imaging (neuroimaging) and genetic determinants from omics data will be analyzed and integrated using explainable AI (XAI) methods, which make it possible to decode the behavior of computational architectures and interpret their results. AntIAGING is promoted by a multidisciplinary consortium including the University of Turin, CENTAI Spa, and EBNeuro Spa — leading companies in the fields of AI and biomedical instrumentation — ensuring the exploitation and practical application of the project outcomes."
