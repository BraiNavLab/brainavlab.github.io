    bio: Lorenza Brusini is Temporary Assistant Professor (RTDa) in Bioengineering at the Dept. of Computer Science, University of Verona, Italy. She received the Master Degree in Bioinformatics and Medical Biotechnologies from the University of Verona (2014) and the Ph.D. Degree in Computer Science with mention Doctor Europaeus from the University of Verona, Italy (2017). From 2017 to 2021 she worked as Post-doc Researcher in the BraiNAVLab headed by Prof. Gloria Menegaz, and she is still working in the same lab as junior researcher. Her main research interests are in the area of Neuroengineering and are focused on brain microstructure and structural connectivity characterization derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging signal modelling. She is also interested in integrating such data with other types like images from different magnetic resonance modalities, genetic information, etc. For this purpose, she is developing artificial intelligence models and interpretability methods to make them explainable and thus more reliable to use for many applications, especially for clinical ones. Artificial intelligence models and connected explainable methods are revealing potential also in her recent research interest in brain computer interface where she can contribute mainly to the exploitation of such a models for real time applications and validation experiments.
