title: Brain Microstructure

description: |
  The diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is sensitive to random movements of nuclear spins carried by particles such as water molecules. The diffusion process in the brain tissue is hindered by its complex architecture due to the broad variety of cellular structures. Microstructure properties can be inferred by fitting the dMRI signal using mathematical models involving different set of parameters. In-vivo microstructure imaging as enabled by the dMRI is a considerable, indispensable, and exciting challenge for shedding light on the biological structures and processes underneath the health and disease brain.
