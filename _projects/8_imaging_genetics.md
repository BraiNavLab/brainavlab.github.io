title: Imaging Genetics

description: |
  The imaging genetics targets the investigation and modelling of the link between image-derived endophenotypes and genetic determinants at different scales. Information regarding genetic variants, either at SNP or aggregated levels, and imaging descriptors derived from different modalities is jointly investigated relying on statistical/machine/deep learning models equipped with explanation and interpretation tools, opening to the holistic modeling of the brain and beyond.
